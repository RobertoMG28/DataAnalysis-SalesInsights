# DataAnalysis-SalesInsights
In this project, I created interactive PowerBI dashboards that are quite useful to analyse a company's sales (with a MySQL database). More specifically, the dataset has been downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales) and it is about the historical sales of a supermarket company which has recorded data in three different branches for three months. Moreover, I have used a public tool (https://sqlizer.io/#/) to convert my dataset file into a MySQL script.
